# LGEA_Cell_Signature

R implementation of elastic net based logistic regression model for predicting the LGEA single cell signature genes

We uses elastic net regularization to fit a logistic regression model to predict each gene's probability being a cell type signature, integrating multiple signature metrics including p-values, effect size, frequency and sensitivity.  A ranking system was then designed to define the signature genes for each cell type.
